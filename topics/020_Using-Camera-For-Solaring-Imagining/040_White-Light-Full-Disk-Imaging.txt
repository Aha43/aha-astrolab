White Light Full Disk Imaging

Insert the T2-to-1.25" eyepiece adapter into the Lunt Herschel wedge.

Mount the ASI174MM into the adapter and secure it using the thumb screw.

This is the only configuration that requires using the eyepiece-style connection, as the Herschel wedge does not offer T2 threads.
Ensure the camera is seated firmly and the thumb screw is tight before imaging.
