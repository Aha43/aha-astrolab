<p>This manual documents the current equipment, configurations, and handling practices used in the aha-astrolab astronomy setup.</p>
<p>Its purpose is to provide clear, step-by-step guidance for safely and effectively operating the instruments, with a focus on solar observation and light visual use at night. It covers mechanical setup, component usage, practical tips, and workflow habits based on direct experience.</p>
<p>This manual will not teach amateur astronomy, but it is intended to support such endeavors by making the equipment easier to use and reducing friction during sessions.</p>
<p>Reading it is strongly recommended before using the system ‚Äî unless, of course, you are already a very experienced telescope handler.</p>
<p>The manual does not include theoretical background, observing techniques, or astrophotography processing instructions. These are considered out of scope, though occasional context may be mentioned where relevant to equipment handling.</p>
<p>All procedures reflect the present state of the equipment. Future upgrades or reconfigurations may be documented separately or as additions to this manual.</p>
