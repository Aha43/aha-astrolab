Mount the Lunt Herschel Wedge
To mount the 1.25" Lunt Herschel wedge to the 2" focuser, first insert the 2" to 1.25" reducer into the focuser.

Use the reducer normally found on the William Optics diagonal. It should still be attached to the diagonal or located with it.

Once the reducer is in place, insert the Herschel wedge and secure it with the thumb screw.

Note: With the reducer removed, the WO diagonal is left without a 2" dust cap. The 2" cap from the focuser can be used to protect the WO diagonal during this configuration.

Once the wedge is installed, it is best to mount the telescope on the tripod before attaching any viewing or imaging equipment.
This applies especially to heavier accessories such as the Pentax Zoom, which should always be mounted when the scope is securely in place.
