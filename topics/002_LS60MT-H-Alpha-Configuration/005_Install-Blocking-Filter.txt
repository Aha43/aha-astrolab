Install The B1200 Blocking Filter

Mount the B1200 blocking filter diagonal into the focuser as shown in the image.
This is the only diagonal that can and must be used in this configuration to safely observe or 
image the Sun.

It is recommended to mount the telescope in this state first, and attach any viewing or imaging
elements (Pentax Zoom, Powermate 2x, or camera in any combination) once the instrument is on the
mount.

Ensure the thumb screws securing the diagonal are tightened before proceeding mounting the telescope.
