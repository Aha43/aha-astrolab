Finding Sun With The SolarQuest

Once the telescope is mounted and ready for solar observation, the final step is to power on the
SolarQuest mount and wait for it to automatically locate and track the Sun.

The video shows the full process. After powering on, the mount will first level the scope and return
it to a known starting position. There will then be a brief pause where nothing appears to 
happen â€” this is normal. The mount is acquiring a GPS signal before continuing with solar alignment.
