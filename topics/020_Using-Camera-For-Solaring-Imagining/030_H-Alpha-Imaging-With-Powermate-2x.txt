H-Alpha Imaging with Powermate 2x

Insert the Powermate 2x into the B1200 diagonal as usual.

Attach the T2 adapter to the Powermate and thread the ASI174MM directly onto it.

This provides a magnified view of solar surface details. As with the previous configuration, 
the entire camera train remains fully threaded for stability.
