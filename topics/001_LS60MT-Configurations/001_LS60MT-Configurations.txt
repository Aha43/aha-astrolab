LS60MT Telescope Configurations

The LS60MT is primarily used to observe and image the Sun in the H-Alpha spectrum. It can also be configured for white light solar observation by removing the H-Alpha filters and installing the Lunt Herschel Diagonal, or used as a regular nighttime telescope with the William Optics Diagonal.

This topic provides an overview of the different configurations. It is particularly important for safety to understand when the LS60MT is properly configured for safe solar observation and imaging.
