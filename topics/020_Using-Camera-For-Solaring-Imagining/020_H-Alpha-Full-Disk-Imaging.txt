H-Alpha Full Disk Imaging

Mount the ASI174MM directly to the B1200 blocking filter diagonal using the T2 thread connection.

No additional adapters are needed.
This configuration provides a full-disk solar image (depending on seeing and camera spacing) and uses the most stable mechanical interface.
